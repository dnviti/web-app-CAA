## ÔøΩüöÄ What is Web App CAA?

Web App CAA is a modern web application built in Go that provides:

- **Interactive Communication Grids**: Create and customize visual communication boards with categories, items, and actions
- **AI-Powered Language Support**: Italian verb conjugation and sentence correction using LLM services
- **User Authentication**: Secure user accounts with JWT-based authentication
- **Flexible Templates**: Choose from default, simplified, or empty grid templates
- **Multi-Database Support**: Works with SQLite for development and MySQL for production

## üèóÔ∏è Key Features

### ‚úÖ **Authentication System**
- Secure user registration with bcrypt password hashing
- JWT-based session management
- Editor password verification for administrative functions
- User status tracking (pending_setup/active)

### ‚úÖ **Grid Management**
- Three pre-built templates: Default, Simplified, and Empty
- Full CRUD operations for grid items
- Hierarchical category organization
- Item ordering and visibility controls
- Customizable colors, icons, and actions

### ‚úÖ **AI Services**
- **Verb Conjugation**: Italian verbs conjugated to present, past, and future tenses
- **Sentence Correction**: Grammar checking and correction
- **Template-based Processing**: Uses Go templates with RAG knowledge
- **Multiple LLM Backends**: Supports Ollama and OpenAI-compatible APIs

### ‚úÖ **Modern Architecture**
- Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns
- RESTful API design
- Middleware for logging and authentication
- Static file serving for web assets
- Docker support for easy deployment
